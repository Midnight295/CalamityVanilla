# CalamityVanilla
 
Welcome to Vanillamity, or "Calamity if it was Vanilla"! This is a mod that reimagines various bosses and items from the Calamity Mod, and reimplenting them in a more vanilla-oriented style. For obvious reasons, not everything from Calamity will be redone.

### THIS IS NOT AN ADDON.
You do not need CalamityMod installed to play this!

### THIS MOD IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH CALAMITY OR CALAMITY FABLES.
This mod shares some similarities with Calamity Fables, however this mod is not intended to be played with either OG Calamity nor Fables. We are not officially tied to either mod.
Furthermore, while Fables was worked on and released first, Vanillamity was in progress before Fables was publically announced. That being said, I'd highly recommend checking out Fables as it is an extremely high-quality mod with a unique spin on Calamity that has a lot of love and care put into it!! https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3449156562
