# CalamityVanilla
 
This is a mod that reimagines various bosses and items from the Calamity Mod, and reimplenting them in a more vanilla-oriented style. For obvious reasons, not everything from Calamity will be redone.

### THIS IS NOT AN ADDON.
You do not need CalamityMod installed to play this!


## Credits

This mod was programmed by sixtydegrees, Jeo, Fredleon, and our good friend Marc0. His work's a specialty.

Credits to the Calamity Mod team for the OG mod, of course!
